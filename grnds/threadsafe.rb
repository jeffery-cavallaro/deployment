module Grnds
  # The ThreadSafe mixin adds a hidden mutex attribute to the including class and uses it to synchronize access to the class's
  # instance variables by overriding the accessor definition class methods.  The class's instance members can also use the
  # 'synchronize' method to synchronize sections of code.
  #
  # CAVEATS:
  #
  #    1.  The including class must define an 'initialize' method that includes a call to 'super()', so that the mutex
  #        attribute is properly initialized.
  #
  #    2.  Code within a synchronize block must access attributes using instance variable syntax (e.g., '@a') - not accessors.
  #        Otherwise, deadlock will occur.
  #
